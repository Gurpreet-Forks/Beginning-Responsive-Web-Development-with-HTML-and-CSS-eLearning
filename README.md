## About the Course

The changing way in which we access the web means that there has never been a greater range of screen sizes and associated user experiences. With these trends driving changes in design, typical desktop-only websites fail to meet even minimum expectations when it comes to style and usability, which can be vital when your website is central to your client's brand.

A responsive web design provides a single solution that looks great on a phone, desktop, and everything in-between, providing the best experience possible for both today's and tomorrow's devices. This course covers every essential aspect of RWD and broader front-end development best practices.

With this course, we have created the definitive guide for all things responsive. We cover the entire gamut of HTML5 and CSS3's new features that help to effortlessly create modern, responsive web designs.
